TinyMCE Enhanced Shortcodes
---------------------------

Itâ€™s possible to parse shortcodes within the visual editor of TinyMCE and make them render actual content, rather than the shortcode itself.

Switching to the `Text` tab allows you to see the actual shortcode again.

Below are the built-in WordPress shortcodes that use this functionality.

The `[audio]` shortcode allows you to embed a single audio file.

The `[caption]` shortcode wraps the image in a div and puts a `<p class="wp-caption-text">` tag around the caption.

The `[gallery]` shortcode allows you to embed several images at once in a div.

The `[playlist]` shortcode allows you to attach more than one media file and render with an html5 playlist.

The `[video]` shortcode is very similar to the `[audio]` shortcode, it simply renders a video instead of audio.
